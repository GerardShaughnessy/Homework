// CSS Media Queries Practice
// Section 2 of 4

// Included in week 5 homework is the index.html file from a site about Andre the Giant.

// In the styles.css file, fix the styling for the site, and create a media query that fixes the site to correctly display on the "iPhone 6/7/8" view in DevTools.

// Focus on the following:

// The #bio <ul> at the top of the page
// <img> tags
// <div> tags
// links
// TIP: you may want to copy-paste some already existing css rules into your media query to make sure you are overwriting the necessary rules.
