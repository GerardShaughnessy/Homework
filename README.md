# Ian "Gerard" Shaughnessy
#### I am from St. Louis and I have been taking photos my whole life.  I am Catholic and pretty moderate with politics.  I am fascinated by economics, filmmaking, social entrepreneurship, and how people come to conclusions and what their philosophies are.  I am ex-military with mental health struggles but I am very hopeful for my future.  

My goals for this course are as follows
- create a good source of income
- learn a skill that can expand my creativity 
- challenge myself
- create a good schedule for health, learning, and work
    - *(this is because I know I will need to continue learning in the industry)* 
- feel like I can accomplish more in my life
